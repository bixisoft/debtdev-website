Open the HTML snippet and drop the sections into your index.html <main> area (it matches the Bootstrap/jQuery skeleton I gave you).

Put the PDF into /assets/downloads/ on your site and link to it from the CTA.

Hand the calculator spec to your devsâ€”it's ready for front-end build now and has clear server-side hooks for later.
